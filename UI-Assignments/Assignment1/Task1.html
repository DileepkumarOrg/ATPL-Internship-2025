        My Projects<br>

        Design of Smart Milk Adulteration System using Machine Learning and Sensors.<br>

        Developed a smart milk adulteration detection system using ML and sensor integration (temperature, turbidity, color, pH, fat) on Raspberry Pi with real-time analysis. Implemented machine learning model (Random Forest) achieving accurate and explainable predictions.<br>

        Mini Project : Implementation of Fingerprint Door lock system by using Arduino Board :<br>
        Designed and implemented a fingerprint-based door lock system using an Arduino board, fingerprint sensor module, and solenoid lock for secure access control. The system authenticates users through biometric verification and activates the lock mechanism upon successful identification.<br>
